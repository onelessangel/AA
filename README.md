## Polinomial Reductions

Solves three types of problems by polynomial reductions to the SAT problem:
- social networks
- advertisements
- registry allocation

### Objectives:
  - Associating and modeling practical applications with NP problems;
  - Implementation of polynomial reductions to the SAT problem.

## Set Theory Research

A short article on the usage of structure data in set theory.

It has a phase dedicated to the data structures implementation and efficiency testing.

Tests were created using an 84,000-word dictionary and a bash test generator.
